# ENF_extraction
Assessing spectral estimation methods for Electric Network Frequency (ENF) Extraction using overplapping windows and Quadratic Interpolation.

A code for ENF extraction is provided including:

1) Signal filtering with a very sharp bandpass filter.

2) ENF extraction procedure using overplapping windows and a Quadratic Interpolation. Very good results achieved due to proper parameter tuning both in the pre-processing step and in the main procedure.

3) Various estimation techniques are employed:
  STFT, Capon, Fast Capon, Fast Iterative Adaptive Approach, Daniell, Blackman-Tukey, Welch, ESPRIT and MUSIC.
